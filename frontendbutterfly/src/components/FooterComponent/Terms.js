        <h4>Butterfly Users Login Plan &amp; FAQs</h4>
        <p>
          Butterfly understands the value of the relationship and respects all
          of every honorable users. Every condition, limitations, status & case
          are mutually considerable if the reasons are valid and understandable
          to the Butterfly users and could create a woeful relationship. This
          site is mainly designed to help those souls who want to fulfill their
          life by keeping and sharing every true information. Otherwise, the
          journey of searching for the perfect match will not be achievable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Am I eligible for the service from this site?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes, if you are of required age. (For male: 27 years and for female:
          23 years).
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Why is there an age limit to login?</h4>
        <p>
          Marriageable age is the minimum age at which a person is allowed by
          law to get married. It is a minimum of 21 years for boys and 18 years
          for girls by law. Age and other prerequisites to marriage vary between
          jurisdictions, but Butterfly has been designed as a creative mannerway
          where someone can independently search his/her perfect match but at
          the same time, and as well as he/she needs to be in a considerable and
          established stage of life. And at this kind of age, we expect mature
          ones to build the strong base of a relationship. Discussion and
          information sharing shouldn’t be like an amateur which might hurt the
          opposite one. So, these are some of the it’s prerequisites that the
          users need to have with some understanding and maturity of users. A
          person should surely be of Open minded and have a simple way to look
          at life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>What is the objective of the site?</h4>
        <p>
          Creating a valuable platform where people can find someone who shares
          the same purpose of life or at least want to enter a journey of mutual
          understanding to possess a perfect become a one in life where
          sacrifice and compromise will be made when needed. None will feel
          pressured and forced to carry on life and the relationship. Life is
          beautiful and precious and so . Butterfly wants to make it best in the
          best possible way.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Why is mutual trust important?</h4>
        <p>
          Mutual trust is very It’s iImportant while getting into a commitment
          and it is a risky journey as well. If you hide yourself, you will
          never trust anyone and think that the opposite one is also absolutely
          hiding information. Trust and dependency are like mirrors in a
          relationship. If you don't believe anyone, then how can anyone start
          trusting and depending on you. So, you should be clear and straight.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Before login what values should I keep in my mind?</h4>
        <p>
          Always remember, hHuman is for hHumanity. So, we expect the required
          and courteous human behaviour from everyone. There are lots of sites
          and apps for making dates or other kinds of relationships which can
          only bring harm to the society as they are just for the time being not
          for any trustworthy commitment. This site is completely developed for
          those honest true souls who are trying to complete their life and want
          to live in a life of joy with their partner by law. We expect those
          who want to plant the seed and nurture the tree of relationship so the
          flower can spread its beautiful fragrance with proper growth.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>How do I keep my information secure and private?</h4>
        <p>
          Butterfly believes in the value of secrecy of your information. So, on
          this site, you are the only owner of your information. But before
          sharing your information with other users, you need to be careful
          enough to understand the maturity and mental state from the opposite
          side as well because if the level of understanding doesn’t match then
          it may be misleading to some extent. And it is not good for any of you
          for sure. So, please don’t be a clown proactively and provoke anyone
          to be a fool.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>What is the trust factor of the site?</h4>
        <p>
          Butterfly aims to share and care for your real status and your
          feelings. So, no need to attract someone by artificial attitude and
          illusion. Try to filter by your choice and not by others preference.
          Be yourself and let people know your true identity.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Why is marriage important?</h4>
        <p>
          Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a
          life-long commitment with many responsibilities as well
        </p>
        <p>
          It gives us a life partner, a teammate, as we move through the
          challenges of life together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marriage is designed for the purity of the relationship. We are at
          risk from different temptations nearly every minute and from many
          directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat that
          temptation by engaging in deep, soothing and satisfying love—a love
          that gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally,
          and spiritually.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marriage makes you grow up really fast with the proper flow of
          emotions, handling many responsibilities and growing mutual
          understanding with that. You get matured because you now have another
          human being apart from yourself to deal with in almost all the
          segments of your life. The growing up lessons you learn in marriage
          can be well applied to other areas of life as well because it teaches
          you many suitable lessons that are required to deal in other areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          A nation with strong marriages is a really strong one with high social
          status. Good marriages are the bedrock of any solid society.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>What is the main objective or Beauty or focus of the site?</h4>
        <p>
          Butterfly is for every true soul out there in the world of the human
          being. Our extensive category and segments will never give you the
          thought that there is no one like you. We prefer this way so that you
          don’t need to pressurize your mind and compromise with yourself and
          your desires. Just login and search for the right one who is also
          probably waiting only for you for quite a long time. But again we
          respect mutual understanding and compromises between partners of life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>What information and documents can I share with users?</h4>
        <p>
          For login purposes you need to share your National ID/ Passport copy,
          Birth certificate, Utility bill copy of current address and police

          emotional conversation which can cause future threat and insecurity.

          conversation because it is self-driven. Only you will be responsible
          for your talk.

        <h4>Can I log in for my family members?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes, you can log in for your sisters, brothers and children only if
          they are unable to login. But you have to provide all the required
          documents (National ID/ Passport copy, Birth certificate, Utility bill
