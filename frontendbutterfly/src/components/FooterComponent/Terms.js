        female: 23 years).
        <br></br>
        <b>Why is there an age limit to login?</b>
        <br></br>Marriageable age is the minimum age at which a person is
        allowed by law to get married. It is a minimum of 21 years for boys and
        18 years for girls by law. Age and other prerequisites to marriage vary
        between jurisdictions, but Butterfly has been designed as a creative
        mannerway where someone can independently search his/her perfect match
        but at the same time, and as well as he/she needs to be in a
        considerable and established stage of life. And at this kind of age, we
        expect mature ones to build the strong base of a relationship.
        Discussion and information sharing shouldn’t be like an amateur which
        might hurt the opposite one. So, these are some of the it’s
        prerequisites that the users need to have with some understanding and
        maturity of users. A person should surely be of Open minded and have a
        simple way to look at life.
        <br></br>
        <b>What is the objective of the site?</b>
        <br></br>Creating a valuable platform where people can find someone who
        shares the same purpose of life or at least want to enter a journey of
        mutual understanding to possess a perfect become a one in life where
        sacrifice and compromise will be made when needed. None will feel
        pressured and forced to carry on life and the relationship. Life is
        beautiful and precious and so . Butterfly wants to make it best in the
        best possible way.
        <br></br>
        <b>Why is mutual trust important?</b>
        <br></br>Mutual trust is very It’s iImportant while getting into a
        commitment and it is a risky journey as well. If you hide yourself, you
        will never trust anyone and think that the opposite one is also
        absolutely hiding information. Trust and dependency are like mirrors in
        a relationship. If you don't believe anyone, then how can anyone start
        trusting and depending on you. So, you should be clear and straight.
        <br></br>
        <b>Before login what values should I keep in my mind?</b>
        <br></br>Always remember, hHuman is for hHumanity. So, we expect the
        required and courteous human behaviour from everyone. There are lots of
        sites and apps for making dates or other kinds of relationships which
        can only bring harm to the society as they are just for the time being
        not for any trustworthy commitment. This site is completely developed
        for those honest true souls who are trying to complete their life and
        want to live in a life of joy with their partner by law. We expect those
        who want to plant the seed and nurture the tree of relationship so the
        flower can spread its beautiful fragrance with proper growth.
        <br></br>
        <b>How do I keep my information secure and private?</b>
        <br></br>Butterfly believes in the value of secrecy of your information.
        So, on this site, you are the only owner of your information. But before
        sharing your information with other users, you need to be careful enough
        to understand the maturity and mental state from the opposite side as
        well because if the level of understanding doesn’t match then it may be
        misleading to some extent. And it is not good for any of you for sure.
        So, please don’t be a clown proactively and provoke anyone to be a fool.
        <br></br>
        <b>What is the trust factor of the site?</b>
        <br></br>Butterfly aims to share and care for your real status and your
        feelings. So, no need to attract someone by artificial attitude and
        illusion. Try to filter by your choice and not by others preference. Be
        yourself and let people know your true identity.
        <br></br>
        <b>Why is marriage important?</b>
        <br></br>Simple:
        <br></br>Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a
        life-long commitment with many responsibilities as well
        <br></br>It gives us a life partner, a teammate, as we move through the
        challenges of life together.
        <br></br>Marriage is designed for the purity of the relationship. We are
        at risk from different temptations nearly every minute and from many
        directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat that
        temptation by engaging in deep, soothing and satisfying love—a love that
        gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally, and
        spiritually.
        <br></br>Marriage makes you grow up really fast with the proper flow of
        emotions, handling many responsibilities and growing mutual
        understanding with that. You get matured because you now have another
        human being apart from yourself to deal with in almost all the segments
        of your life. The growing up lessons you learn in marriage can be well
        applied to other areas of life as well because it teaches you many
        suitable lessons that are required to deal in other areas.
        <br></br>A nation with strong marriages is a really strong one with high
        social status. Good marriages are the bedrock of any solid society.
        <br></br>
        <b>What is the main objective or Beauty or focus of the site?</b>
        <br></br>Butterfly is for every true soul out there in the world of the
        human being. Our extensive category and segments will never give you the
        thought that there is no one like you. We prefer this way so that you
        don’t need to pressurize your mind and compromise with yourself and your
        desires. Just login and search for the right one who is also probably
        waiting only for you for quite a long time. But again we respect mutual
        understanding and compromises between partners of life.
        <br></br>
        <b>What information and documents can I share with users?</b>
        <br></br>For login purposes you need to share your National ID/ Passport
        copy, Birth certificate, Utility bill copy of current address and police
        verification if needed. But Bbutterfly will not share this information

        prefer not to share your sensitive or personal information in between
        the conversation with the opposite side user before fixing or finalizing
        anything. Please don’t share any sensitive pictures or emotional
        conversation which can cause future threat and insecurity. Remember,
        Because Butterfly does not have any authority in your conversation
        because it is self-driven. Only you will be responsible for your talk.
